# Dystonia Analysis

This project contains all the scripts I developed so far for organization and analysis of the data available from the Dystonia Project.

It includes:

## 1. Dystonia Analysis Environment

## 2. Jupyter Notebooks Folder 

## 3. Matlab files for generation of processed CNMFE dictionaries that can be opened in python

## 4. 

I want to improve this description, however I am now focused on creating a database with all the files for every mice, in order to replicate the analysis developed in **Single_session_analysis.ipynb**.
