# Dystonia Analysis

This project contains all the scripts I developed so far for organization and analysis of the data available from the Dystonia Project.

It includes:

## 1. Dystonia Analysis Environment

## 2. Jupyter Notebooks Folder 

## 3. Matlab files for generation of processed CNMFE dictionaries that can be opened in python

## 4. .py files for creating a dataframe with all path and replicating the current state of the analysis for all groups

Add indications for other possible users, namely the order in which the files should be run.

I want to improve this description, however I am now focused on creating a database with all the files for every mice, in order to replicate the analysis developed in **Single_session_analysis.ipynb**.
