# access all acceleration files

# establish a treshold for movement initiation using acceleration (accelerometer palced in the head)

# study the distribution of acceleration within session and across sessions

# load dystonia database


# across session and take the mean 

    # single plot with all sessions in a specific time point overlayed in the same plot

    # check mean

# join all values from all files and check disctribution (what could we consider if there was a clear binomial distribution? could we use that treshold?)


# try opening one of the created files with values and timestamps and plot
