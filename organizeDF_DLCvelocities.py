#in order to run this, it is necessary to have the file containing the organized DLC coordinate predictions as well as the respective timestamps

#get the paths for the files containing the organized DLC coordinate predictions

#open the file as a data frame

#create a function to calculate the x and y velocity components as well as the vector magnitude
#create a new data frame containing only the vector magnitude of each bodypart as well as the timestamps (eliminate the likelihoods)
